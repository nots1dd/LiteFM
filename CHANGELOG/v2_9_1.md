# Change Type:Minor

# Summary of the changes

-> Added a new function cap_label_length to the inodeinfo.h/inodeinfo.c module for determining printable length of labels based on current window width or fixed max length, whichever is
more restrictive.

-> Restricted the length of current directory, parent, and child
inodes, as well as the file name field in the file info window, 
to prevent overrun onto the next line.

-> Add single quotes to the unzip/7z/tar commands to prevent issues with filenames containing spaces in filepreview module.

-> Modified the process of truncating strings and adding ellipses ("...") for the following labels:
    - Filename in selected file info window at top right.
    - Filenames in current dir. in left window.
    - Parent directories at bottom right in info window.
    - Child inodes at bottom right in info window.
